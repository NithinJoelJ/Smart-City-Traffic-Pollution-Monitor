# Smart City Traffic & Pollution Monitor

A comprehensive real-time dashboard for monitoring urban traffic and air quality across Tamil Nadu, with a special focus on the Vellore district. This project integrates advanced data visualization techniques such as geospatial mapping, time-series analysis, and multivariate correlation studies to deliver meaningful insights for smart city development.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Live traffic and AQI tracking with automatic updates  
- **Multi-Scale Analysis:** Coverage across 15 Tamil Nadu districts and 15 Vellore sub-regions  
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Heatmaps, choropleth maps, and time-series dashboards  
- **Advanced Analytics:** Correlation, distribution, and pollution pattern studies  
- **Smart Alerts:** Real-time congestion and incident detection
